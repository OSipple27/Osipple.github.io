<p> These items are cheaper than suits but are also the most commonly forgotten on the wedding day. It's a custom for you to buy your groomsmen a gift for the wedding (considering all that they will be paying for travel, bachelor party, etc.). So I decided to buy my groomsmen their shoes, bowties, and accessories. Doing this ensured my groomsmen had a uniform look and that no of them forgot any of the needed items for the wedding day.</p>
<h1> Do you know how to put in a boutonniere?</h1>
<p> Day: May 29th. Time: I'm not sure my nerves were everywhere.

If I can give any advice I would say remember who you and your bride are. Remember your journey and the bare your soul! You only do this once...well some of us</p>
